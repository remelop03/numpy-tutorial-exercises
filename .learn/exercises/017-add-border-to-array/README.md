# `017` Add Border to Array

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add zero (0) as the border values of the one's matrix that you created in the previous exercise.

2. Print the matrix in the console.

## 💻 Expected Output:

```bash
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ The `np.pad()` method modifies a matrix values. You can read more about this method here: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html
